# Data_Toolkit
We have developed a suite of data tools to help keep data preparation on schedule and within budget.  This toolkit provides a remarkably easy, low-cost way to create codebooks, master lists of SAS data sets for a project, reports of variables needing special investigation, and data crosswalks showing the relationship of variables across datasets.
